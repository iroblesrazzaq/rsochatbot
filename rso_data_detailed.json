    "full_description": "The American Lung Cancer Screening Initiative (ALCSI) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that consists of a network of students and doctors across the nation, striving to increase lung cancer screening awareness. Among all the university chapters of ALCSI, our UChicago chapter is uniquely positioned on the Southside of Chicago. Everyday we work to increase screening within the Southside of Chicago. We are partnered with the UChicago Medicine Screening Center and many other leaders who aim to decrease health inequity. Our goals are to make tangible impacts that save lives. Lung Cancer is the number one cause of cancer related death. In its early stages, lung cancer is often curable, but it is also silent. Thus, there is no way to detect it, except for screenings. However, if the lung cancer gets to late stages, it will metastasize. At that point, life expectancy is generally 2 years. Thus, screening is critical for saving lives. However, as of 2024, only 6% of vulnerable individuals are getting screened for lung cancer. Our team organizes grassroots events in the Southside of Chicago. We speak to thousands of individuals about lung cancer screening and help them determine if they are eligible for the screening. Our hardworking team members can be found at churches, festivals, health fairs, and food pantries. When they aren't in the field, they're writing thousands of emails to organize more events and helping enroll patients to get them screened. If these words speak to you, consider joining our team! This organization is not low commitment, as we seek individuals who are extremely passionate about our goals. We are a family and will help each other as needed, so you're never alone. You don't need to be a pre-med to join this extremely strategy oriented club. However, if you are, you will gain many unique clinical hours.",

Here are some of the projects that APAMSA is working on currently: 1)\u00a0APAMSA recently initiated a cultural humility program with the Bridgeport Free Clinic (BFC) to help Pritzker medical students learn more about the predominantly Chinese American patient population served by the BFC in order to better serve them. 2) APAMSA recently established a mentorship program, supported by the Office of Multicultural Students Affairs, for pre-medical students identifying as Asian/Pacific American (AAPI) at the University of Chicago. This program is a chance for AAPI pre-medical students to meet with AAPI medical students who have similar upbringings and callings to medicine and receive guidance on studying, medical school applications, and tips on opportunities to pursue to learn more about various pathways in health professions. 3) APAMSA is partnering with the South Asian Medical Students Association (SAMSA) in organizing the inaugural conferenceAsians in Medicine: A Conference on Advocacy and Allyshipon May 18th.\u00a0The objectives of this conference are threefold.\u00a0The first is to raise awareness of Asian American health disparities, such as the disproportionately high prevalence of HBV and diabetes, as well as to highlight the work of nonprofit organizations to serve the needs of various Asian American ethnic enclaves throughout Chicago, such as Chinatown and Devon. The second objective is to have Asian American medical leaders based throughout Chicago to meet with participants to talk about their career paths and to provide guidance on how to overcome the \u201cbamboo ceiling\u201d to pursue leadership positions in medicine. The final objective of the conference is to talk more critically about Asian Americans\u2019 position as overrepresented minorities in highly privileged professions such as medicine; discuss strategies for partnering with other communities of color to develop a common agenda for addressing systemic health disparities; and to provide a space for participants to talk about challenges faced by Asian American health professionals that are often ignored, such as microaggressions from colleagues and racism from patients.

Slam poetry has a unique ability to highlight both the facts and more personal pieces of any given event, making it a highly powerful tool and a deeply touching art form. It's a medium for stories that resonate deeply and one for tales nearly akin to stand up comedy: whatever you've been dying to say, you can say it here, and we'd be more than happy to have you. In the past, we've heard poems about lost love, politics, Burger King wedding vows, and so much more. We're here to make sure that the many talented voices of our community have the chance to explore the genre, learning and growing as writers, performers, and people. Okay, you get it, it's a good time. But what's itactuallylike to be a member? During each meeting, we partake in free-writing and tea-spilling, ending with a fun writing activity. Outside of weekly meetings, poets are encouraged to participate in more rigorous (and often more exciting) projects such as group performances. And of course, sharing your words with the people around you means you're more than likely to make a few new friends, too.",

The group partners with intergovernmental organizations, think tanks, and nonprofit organizations in doing so, with the main goal of supporting policymakers through pro-bono research. Our work involves the study, determination, and interpretation of economic, political, and social facts relating to questions of significance on behalf of our clients. Our research is conducted using objective scientific principles and academic norms \u2013 our conclusions are based on empirical evidence without regard to the special interests of any group in the body politic for governments and nonprofit organizations. For example, in Fall 2023 we worked with the Census Bureau to create a novel comprehensive dataset on the US Cannabis Industry, analyzing trends in license issuance, dispensary concentration, product pricing, etc. We presented our results to the Census ADEP Team and discussed the policy implications of our findings. Ultimately, our goal is to influence positive, welfare-maximizing change in public policy through economic analysis. Some of our former and current project partners across our 3 chapters include: Federal Agencies (Departments of Transportation, Commerce, Energy, State, Census Bureau), the UN Development Programme, Chelsea Public Schools, Brookings Institution, World Bank, and NASA.",

    "full_description": "The purpose of this organization shall be to preserve and practice the art of Commedia on campus and to share it with the UChicago community. Commedia is a sixteenth-century art form hailing from Italia that marries physical theater, improvisation, mask work, song, dance, and slapstick humor. \u00a0It is the root of many of today\u2019s popular art forms, such as ballet, opera, pantomime, and sketch comedy. \u00a0We collaborate in the process of bringing this unique tradition into today\u2019s world with unbridled enjoyment. We believe in the fundamental power of the ensemble as an artistic unit. Working as an ensemble, where relationships, not individuals, define the audience\u2019s focus, helps us to create a compelling performance and also a community. When Commedia casts its ensemble, the Attori Senza Paura, we cast them for a year, as we feel a year is necessary to engender the type of familiarity needed to have a strong group of actors. Commedia approaches acting from a physical perspective. We connect to our characters emotionally by literally embodying them, and letting the mental aspect of the performance flow from this base. In other words, we love gestures. Commedia takes the art of not taking oneself seriously extremely seriously. Commedia understands that the human condition is often found in its extremes: characters fighting over a cookie as though it is a matter of life or death. We hope to convey this message to the UChicago populace.",

    "full_description": "The University of Chicago Emergency Medical Services (UCEMS) is a student-driven organization committed to providing exceptional emergency medical care and fostering a culture of preparedness within the University community. Our mission is to train, certify, and deploy Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) who operate within the scope of practice, ensuring the safety and well-being of individuals at various campus events and activities. UCEMS is dedicated to continuous improvement, collaboration with medical professionals, and contributing to the broader emergency medical education. Currently, UCEMS runs two training courses, provides opportunities for club members to practice emergency medicine by providing first aid assistance at intramural sports (facilitated through Intramural Director Matthew Fox), and puts on community building events to increase club membership and spread awareness of crucial life-saving skills (CPR, Stop the Bleed). First, we engage with the broader student community by offering an EMR (Emergency Medical Responders) course to provide interested students with a lower commitment, quarter-long course to learn the basics of emergency medicine and gain CPR licenses. Students who have taken our EMR course have expressed an interest in continuing to take an more intensive EMT course to obtain a higher level licensure which they can use to staff with UCEMS and access volunteer and career opportunities with emergency medical organizations across Chicago. EMRs and EMTs who have passed their respective classes are invited to join our Responder in Training (RIT) course, which consists of a 3 week review of unit procedures and scenario practice, before undergoing advancement testing to formally join UCEMS as a practicing responder. Practicing responders staff intramural sports events in teams of two, providing invaluable first aid supplies and on scene medical treatment for any injuries. Practicing responders also attend weekly drill sessions, which are community bonding events through which the UCEMS Quality Improvement Officer reviews or introduces new skills to the unit. UCEMS is also dedicated to promoting basic first aid and health literacy among our community. Every year, UCEMS leads a SPLASH course to certify local high school students in CPR. We also host quarterly open drills, open to all, in which unit members demonstrate skills such as splinting broken bones, controlling bleeding, or doing basic medical assessments, to encourage others to become involved in UCEMS and pursue an emergency medicine prehospital license. Within the unit, we host quarterly social events designed to connect students interested in pursuing medical careers to form a support network. Finally, we periodically invite our faculty club advisor (Dr. Willard Sharp of UCMed) and Pritzker Medical School students to speak at drill meetings to allow club members to learn about various careers in medicine. We look forward to continuing these professional development opportunities next year by connecting students with shadowing opportunities with emergency medicine physicians and allowing responders to gain more patient experience by operating at the EMT level.",

Our group is split into 3 distinct working groups.\u00a0The Data Analysis working group quality controls, performs statistical analyses on, and produces engaging graphics of our project data sets.\u00a0The Policy working group synthesizes the output from the Data Analysis working group with their own social science research to produce novel policy solutions to environmental and urban problems. Finally, the Community Outreach working group takes all these results and works with community leaders to hone our solutions towards a feasible, sustainable product that can be implemented in the Chicago community. The ERG also runs the Intercollegiate Sustainability Alliance with 4 other Chicago colleges and helped to start the UChicago Environmental Alliance, a unified group of all environmental RSOs on campus.",

Around bread and cheese, members meet fellow francophiles, discuss current French affairs, watch French movies or play games in French in a flexible, non-academic setting. Annual EventsEvery year, the French Club brings the best of French culture to campus with three events open to the entire campus community. Past events have included: Speed-dating in French, Cheese Tasting, Study Abroad Q&A and Crepe Study Break. We are looking to introduce our \"Cultural Series\" this year, consisting of one major event per quarter, which will focus on one particular Francophone region. We will also offer one major event per quarter that focuses more on practicing French. Speaker SeriesLaunched in 2012, our Speaker Series seeks to foster discussion on a wide breadth of issues in contemporary France. We invite practitioners at the heart of French political and social life to share their experience and provide context surrounding certain \"Franco-French\" particularities, which can sometimes be baffling from an American perspective. Our first speaker was Fadela Amara, former French junior minister of Urban Policy and founder of the feminist organization Ni Putes Ni Soumises (Neither Whores Nor Submissive) which supported the 2010 ban on burqas in France. Since then, we have hosted events on campus with Julia Kristeva, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lefebvre, Henry Laurens, Laurent Fabuis, Dominique de Villepin, Zineb el Razhoui, and Marie-Monique Robin.",

Four core programs form the heart of the Institute: civic engagement opportunities that enable students to experience politics-in-action through political exploration trips, leadership training, service programs and voter engagement projects; visiting fellowships where distinguished political officials, policymakers, journalists, diplomats and others are in residence on campus during an academic quarter; political and public service internships that provide students with paid, substantive career development opportunities; and a continuous series of public events featuring leading political figures sharing their insights on key issues of the day.",

Setting a precedent in 1980, we hosted the first culture show on campus and have since established an annual KSO tradition for the past 33 years. Our mission is to represent the Korean community and strengthen its voice on (and beyond) campus and to bring together those who have a common interest in Korean culture through social activities and events. Additionally, we seek to extend an open dialogue between a diverse range of ethnic groups in order to establish a positive relationship for the whole of the University community. Finally, we hope to spread awareness of the Korean culture to the entire student body by sponsoring various University-wide events. Our constitution may be found here. We also seek to give to the community by raising funds for various charitable organizations like Korean American Women In Need (KANWIN) and Agglobe Services (North Korean food aid). For more information about KSO, please join the KSO listhost. If you have further questions, feel free to contact any of the board members. Also feel free to come out to an event even if you have not attended any of the previous events or joined the listhost.",

    "full_description": "MEDLIFE stands for \"Medicine, Education, and Development to Low Income Families Everywhere.\" Our RSO focuses on the intersection of these components in developing health and well-being on the South Side of Chicago and in our international chapter settings. Equity and sustainability are the driving values in the work we do both on campus and in communities abroad. The cornerstone of MEDLIFE is week-long mobile clinic trips to improve access to basic healthcare in low-resource communities in Latin America.\u00a0These trips are open to the general campus community, and provide an opportunity for students to engage in sustainable, locally-driven health clinics and development projects in rural communities. We also raise funds for development projects in Ecuador, Peru, and Tanzania that provide sustainable change in a culturally sensitive manner by funding clinics, schools, and safe living environments.Additionally, our chapter prioritizes local community engagement to improve health and well-being. The Community Service Committee organizes service trips to community-based organizations like Heartland Alliance Vital Bridges Food Pantry, Hyde Park Neighborhood Club, or Ronald McDonald House Charities.Our last goal as an organization is to increase awareness among the University community about global health and issues such as health equity. We strive to give students at the University a chance to discuss and research pertinent health problems, while also inviting multidisciplinary guest speakers to lead discussions or participate in panel presentations.

We can't wait to have you join! ChoMUN and Team have a large membership overlap, but are functionally distinct organizations, as outlined below: TEAM Team is a close-knit community within the larger sphere of Model UN on campus. We train, travel, and compete together, attending conferences in Chicago, Boston, New York, D.C., Montreal, and Los Angeles. Team, aside from being a great way to develop public speaking and research skills, is a fantastic place to establish mentorship connections and forge long-lasting friendships. New members are eligible to attend conferences starting in November, and we would love for you to join us as we kick off the fall season!! We encourage everyone, regardless of past MUN experience, to come try it out! All majors and interests are welcome, and a vast variety of topics and competitive experiences await you. ChoMUN Hosted by UChicago since 1998, ChoMUN is the premier intercollegiate crisis-focused Model UN conference on the circuit. We run simulations of bodies (known as \u201ccommittees\u201d) in which delegates assume a character or country and have the chance to change history, both through the committee\u2019s collective actions and their own personal powers. ChoMUN staffers help run committees by creating content and conducting the simulation and planning the committee's narrative, or by assisting in the administrative functions of the conference. ChoMUN will be held spring Quarter at the Palmer House hotel in downtown Chicago. Leading up to the conference, we will hold weekly meetings featuring breakouts into committee subunits along with ChoMUN-wide events. Bonding and community are a central part of the ChoMUN experience, and we're excited to see you all in person this year! ChoMUN is consistently the largest RSO on campus \u2013 but due to our nature of being broken down into USG groups and committees, there are many small communities within the bigger ChoMUN family. We're so ecstatic to meet you, and hope that you join us this year! To learn more, head over tohttp://chomun.org/staff-chomunor email our Chief of Staff atcos@chomun.org.",

Coleman, and George A. Smith (known as the \u201cChicago Six\u201d) in 1975. The NSBE Torch symbolizes the organization\u2019s everlasting, burning desire to achieve success in this competitive society and to effect positive change in the quality of life of all people. The same light that flows from the NSBE Torch to students and professionals in the United States is also useful for NSBE members in other countries in the Americas (Canada, South America, and the Caribbean), as well as in Africa, Europe, South America, Asia, and Australia. The lightning bolts represent the striking impact that will be felt upon society and industry as a result of the contributions and achievements made by NSBE. The organization has since grown to over 30,000 members worldwide, with its headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. NSBE's primary mission is \"to increase the number of culturally responsible black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally, and positively impact the community.\" NSBE offers its members leadership training, professional development, mentoring opportunities, career placement services and more. It is NSBE's goal to expand its mission and vision to as many countries around the world as possible, thereby creating a global network of Black engineers, scientists and technologists that support each other, and the cultures they impact.",

For those of you who want to know what Ultimate is,USA Ultimatedescribes it as the \"non-stop movement and athletic endurance of soccer with the aerial passing skills of football.\" Another key component of Ultimate is the \"Spirit of the Game\". Ultimate tends to be a fun, spirited sport, and all levels of commitment and skill are welcomed. \"Open\" is the official term used by USA ultimate\u00a0for the 'men's' division of play because\u00a0while men's division teams most often consist of only male-identifying players, players who identify as female are allowed to compete in this division, thus making it \"open\" to any gender in terms of eligibility. We host two open teams. Fission is our A-team and is the highest level of open ultimate at UChicago, representing the university in the USA Ultimate D-I College Division, and as such represents a serious commitment.\u00a0Players on Fission are also expected to attend three regular season tournaments and the college series postseason (consisting of sectionals, regionals, and, hopefully, nationals). Hedonism Bots, our B-team, is a rising program in the developmental division. However, it does not carry the same rigor in performance and commitment that Fission does. Attendance to practices, tournaments, and pods is not required for B-team membership, and anybody interested in ultimate at UChicago may participate in B-team practices. The goal of Bots is to provide a fun, inclusive environment for people who enjoy playing ultimate. We generally practice 2-3 times a week (twice during the week and once during the weekends) in addition to informal throwing sessions and workouts, and we go to several tournaments a season. We pride ourselves on sportsmanship, spirit, and fun.So come and see what playing for Fission and Bots is all about! *If you're interested in joining, please email us at\u00a0chicagoultimate@gmail.com.",

    "full_description": "Statement of Purpose: Platypus is a project for the self-criticism, self-education, and, ultimately, the practical reconstitution of a Marxian Left. At present the Marxist Left appears as a historical ruin. The received wisdom of today dictates that past, failed attempts at emancipation stand not as moments full of potential yet to be redeemed, but rather as \u201cwhat was\u201d \u2014 utopianism that was bound to end in tragedy. As critical inheritors of a vanquished tradition, Platypus contends that \u2014 after the failure of the 1960s New Left, and the dismantlement of the welfare state and the destruction of the Soviet Union in the 1980s-90s \u2014 the present disorientation of the Left means we can hardly claim to know the tasks and goals of social emancipation better than the \u201cutopians\u201d of the past did. Our task is critique and education towards the reconstitution of a Marxian Left. Platypus contends that the ruin of the Marxist Left as it stands today is of a tradition whose defeat was largely self-inflicted, hence at present the Marxist Left is historical, and in such a grave state of decomposition that it has become exceedingly difficult to draft coherently programmatic social-political demands. In the face of the catastrophic past and present, the first task for the reconstitution of a Marxian Left as an emancipatory force is to recognize the reasons for the historical failure of Marxism and to clarify the necessity of a Marxian Left for the present and future. \u2014If the Left is to change the world, it must first transform itself! The improbable \u2014 but not impossible \u2014 reconstitution of an emancipatory Left is an urgent task; we believe that the future of humanity depends on it. While the devastating forces unleashed by modern society \u2014 capitalism \u2014 remain, the unfulfilled promise of social emancipation still calls for redemption. To abdicate this or to obscure the gravity of past defeats and failures by looking to \u201cresistance\u201d from \u201coutside\u201d the dynamics of modern society is to affirm its present and guarantee its future destructive reality. Platypus asks the questions: How is the thought of critical theorists of modern society such as Marx, Luk\u00e1cs, Benjamin and Adorno relevant for the struggle for social emancipation today? How can we make sense of the long history of impoverished politics on the Left leading to the present \u2014 after the international Marxist Left of Lenin, Luxemburg and Trotsky, to the barrenness of today \u2014 without being terrorized or discouraged by this history? \u2014 How might the answers to such questions help the urgent task of reconstituting the Left at its most fundamental levels of theory and practice? How might we help effect escape from the dead-end the Left has become? We hope to re-invigorate a conversation on the Left that has long since fallen into senility or silence, in order to help found anew an emancipatory political practice that is presently absent. What has the Left been, and what can it yet become?\u2014 Platypus exists because the answer to such a question, even its basic formulation, has long ceased to be self-evident.",

In 1991 Dr. William H. Rosenblatt, Professor of Anesthesiology at Yale University School of Medicine, founded REMEDY with the mission of collecting surgical supplies for use in medical mission trips to Latin America. The University of Chicago chapter of REMEDY has expanded Dr. Rosenblatt\u2019s vision. In the past, REMEDY members have volunteered with the CerviCusco clinic in Cusco, Peru, an organization that is dedicated to providing needed healthcare and screening for women. Pritzker medical students from this chapter have also organized direct medical service trips to many locations around the world, including the Dominican Republic and Cuba. In the summer of 2023, the REMEDY team visited Centro de Salud Santa Clotilde, a health center along the Napo River in the Peruvian Amazon region of Loreto. Our team consisted of six first-year medical students and three family medicine physicians from the Chicagoland area. Through our partnership with the physicians and volunteers at Santa Clotilde, we were able to provide medical care to 412 patients in the area. Without the extra manpower, the doctors at Santa Clotilde would have been unable to travel to these distant communities and provide medical care. We hope to continue strengthening this newfound partnership with Santa Clotilde so that this can become an annual service trip.",

These principles include the full decolonization of all illegally held Palestinian lands, the repatriation of Palestinian refugees in accordance with the Right of Return, an end to all discriminatory laws and systems targeting the indigenous Palestinian population, and a total end to the occupation of Palestine.Just as SJP at the University of Chicago condemns the discrimination underlying the policies and laws of Israel\u2019s colonization of Palestinian land, SJP at the University of Chicago rejects and condemns all other forms of hatred, intolerance, or discrimination against any religious, racial, or ethnic group. This group is committed towards overcoming anti-Semitic sentiments towards both Arabs and Jews in every community.Rooting its strength in the diversity of its membership, SJP at the University of Chicago welcomes individuals of all backgrounds to join in solidarity with the struggle for freedom and justice in Palestine.",

We also offer career-building events such as lectures, certification training workshops, and research presentations. SEDS hosts a beautiful community of students in physics, enjoying movie nights, social outings, and our annual trip to the SpaceVision Conference. About the national organization: Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS) is a 501(c)3 non-profit that empowers young people to participate and make an impact on space exploration. SEDS helps students develop their technical and leadership skills by providing opportunities to manage and participate in national projects as well as to attend conferences, publish their work, and develop their professional network, in order to help students become more effective in their present and future careers in industry, academia, government, and education. SEDS was founded as a chapter-based organization in 1980 at MIT by Peter Diamandis, at Princeton University by Scott Scharfman, and at Yale University by Richard Sorkin. SEDS-USA was founded as a national group in 1982 by Peter Diamandis, Bob Richards, and Todd Hawley. The largest student-run space organization in the world, it consists of an international community of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from a diverse range of educational backgrounds in chapters all over the world, including Canada, India, Israel, Mexico, Nepal, Nigeria, Philippines, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.",

    "full_description": "Supplies For Dreams is\u00a0unique among organizations which engage with CPS students\u00a0because we neither tutor students in any academic subject, nor\u00a0provide direct assistance with homework or schoolwork. Our purpose is, rather, to help students gain the\u00a0general mindset and skill set they will need to succeed at anything they want to pursue in life. We\u00a0aim to grow students\u2019 love of learning, broad worldview, confidence and agency, via a broad\u00a0curriculum consisting of one-on-one mentoring and field trip programming, designed by the parent Supplies For Dreams nonprofit organization over the past several years (and constantly evolving). The fundamental motive behind SFD is that helping underprivileged\u00a0kids with homework and schoolwork alone is not nearly sufficient to bridge the huge opportunity\u00a0gap between them and those more privileged - one major measure of that gap being college\u00a0enrollment, as 82% of Chicago Public School students, as of now, do not obtain a Bachelor's\u00a0Degree. We have the ability to help bridge that gap in some significant ways. Our\u00a0mentoring and field trip curricula are centered around the pillars of Agency, Self-Confidence,\u00a0Broad Worldview, and Love of Learning - the four major characteristics we aim to improve in our\u00a0students. Mentors work one-on-one, as well as in groups (groups of mentors working with groups\u00a0of students) with 6th grade CPS students, once a week for 1.5 hours, at a time determined\u00a0based on both CPS availability and our mentors' availability. The first part of our mentoring curriculum is focused on teaching CPS students about a wide spectrum of different careers (through a combination of teaching and active engagement of students in related activities which we have prepared), as well as what steps they would need to take in order to pursue those different careers. The next part of the mentoring curriculum involves\u00a0guiding students through the conception and (ideally) actualization of their own ideas for\u00a0a community service project, and then a new business/product. We walk students through the phases of\u00a0brainstorming, how to begin a community service and business project, facing failures, measuring risks, budgeting, marketing, etc. This helps students grow confidence in their critical thinking skills and ability to achieve goals. Field Trip Hosts take 6th-8th grade students to places like the Museum of Science and Industry, the\u00a0Field Museum, the Adler Planetarium, the Shedd Aquarium, the Chicago History Museum, and the\u00a0Art Institute. The field trips, which are paid for by SFD, are designed to spark students' curiosity, broaden their worldview, and engage them in critical thinking - hosts prepare beforehand to talk\u00a0to the students about what they are seeing in the museums, and to engage them in\u00a0discussion about the history, science, art, etc. Each field trip host is expected to take part in at least\u00a02 (of 4-5 total) field trips per quarter (several field trip hosts lead each field trip together). Field\u00a0trips are always planned well ahead of time so that they take place at a time that works for both\u00a0the UChicago hosts and the CPS student group. Further field trip programming includes a program called Kids To Campus,\u00a0where students come to our campus to engage in activities led by multiple RSO\u2019s\u00a0(with the overall event being organized by us, in collaboration with those RSO\u2019s), and through this gain insight\u00a0into the opportunities available in college for exploration of one\u2019s interests, personal growth, and\u00a0career advancement.",

    "full_description": "Taekwondo can be roughly translated as \"The Way of the Hand and Foot\" and is a traditional Korean martial art. Officially introduced as an Olympic Sport in 2000 and thought to be the world's most popular martial art, Taekwondo has a history that stretches back to ancient Korea. As the name suggests, Taekwondo is more than a sport or fighting style, it is a way of life. The ultimate goal of Taekwondo is self-improvement through disciplining the mind and conditioning the body. The University of Chicago Taekwondo Club is led and taught by volunteer members of the university community. As our instructors come from a variety of training backgrounds there is a diversity of style not present in many traditional schools. This results in a training environment that is collaborative rather than dogmatic. For anyone interested in learning a martial art or improving their physical fitness in a friendly environment, the Taekwondo Club is an excellent choice. We welcome students of all skill levels and types of martial arts experience. Please contact an instructor if you have questions. If you want to know if Taekwondo is for you, the best way to find out is to try a class.",

From our vantage point, this experience is only exacerbated for Black graduate students here. BGC hopes to actively disrupt that reality and bring Black grads together. We celebrate Black excellence, Black community, and Black culture.

With each Community Health Project that we take on,\u00a0our chapter begins with an assessment of our community through data collection, meetings with local organizations, and interviews with individuals. Armed with this information, we then develop a targeted, long-term action plan centered around partnership with and empowerment of local partner organizations. We compile our findings and present the results of our work in a publishable report. On campus, we seek to bridge the gap between the University and Chicago by bringing in speakers that are not only academics but Chicagoland health professionals and representatives from our local partners. We hope to foster open, nuanced conversations on the intersections of health, social class, race, gender, in Chicago and beyond.",

    ],
    "full_description": "What Is WYSE?WYSE is a national mentoring organization dedicated to strengthening the lives of young women and their communities. It is a curriculum based mentorship program striving to address issues that will facilitate the self-empowerment of young women, including topics such as racism, sexism, healthy body image, comprehensive sex education, sexual orientation, drugs, gangs, teenage pregnancy, and future options. WYSE began at UCLA in 1992 and has spread to 13 branches at 12 universities nationwide. The National Resource Office (NRO) recently dissolved and is now in the form of a Board of Directors. They hope to restore the NRO in the near future. Mission & Goals:(1) To provide middle school girls with the resources and support necessary to make informed decisions about relationships, sexual health, and their futures. (2) To provide college women with the skills and insight necessary to become life-long advocates for expanding opportunities for all women. (3) To provide a national network of support and friendship between young women working towards positive changes in their communities. Why WYSE?WYSE works with middle school girls from under-resourced areas. At this age, girls are beginning to make decisions about themselves, their relation to males, their racial, gender, and class identities, and their position in society. This is further complicated when the girls are part of a racial/ethnic minority and in an under-resourced community. Where Does WYSE Work?The University of Chicago branch of WYSE works at John B. Drake Elementary School on the South Side of Chicago. Drake is part of the Dearborn Homes community. Prior to working at Drake, the U of C WYSE chapter worked in at Madero Middle School in Little Village for twenty years. WYSE Mentees:The girls we mentor are from the 6th, 7th, and 8thgrades at John B. Drake Elementary School. They are at a difficult stage of development and are still rather impressionable, which is why our program targets this age group. However, we avoid making generalizations about the girls in terms of their knowledge regarding sex, drugs, and gangs. Girls join WYSE out of their own interest and often express a full spectrum of enthusiasm about the program, the mentors, and the lessons. WYSE Mentors:Our group of mentors is very diverse, which is beneficial for the mentees as they are exposed to a variety of women from different cultural groups. We are looking for women of all backgrounds and interests who believe strongly in the WYSE mission and who feel comfortable discussing serious topics with young girls. All mentors must commit to attending all sessions, meetings, and events, and to follow through on individual time with their mentees.",

All classes are multi-level, so beginners are welcome at any time. Sticky mats and all other props are provided. We recommend practitioners to come to class in shorts (or some other legwear that reveals the curvature of the knee) and on an empty stomach.
