      "1. **AI @ UChicago**: This RSO is specifically focused on artificial intelligence and offers a range of educational opportunities, hands-on projects, and community-building activities related to AI. They cover topics such as AI ethics, applications, and technologies, which sounds like it would be right up your alley. You can get involved by joining their mailing list or reaching out to their contact, Arjun Sohur, at [arjunsohur@uchicago.edu](mailto:arjunsohur@uchicago.edu). You can also check out their website at <https://ai-uchicago.com/> or follow them on social media.\n",
      "2. **UChicago ACM**: While this RSO is not exclusively focused on AI or machine learning, they do have committees dedicated to these topics. UChicago ACM is the University of Chicagoâ€™s student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and they offer hands-on experience outside of the classroom through their machine learning and software engineering committees. They also hold general meetings that give students the opportunity to connect and learn from professionals in various industries of computer science. You can get involved by joining their mailing list or following them on social media.\n",
      "3. **UChicago Data Science Society**: This RSO is focused on data science, which often involves machine learning and AI. They provide an alternative space for people to learn and discuss data science, as well as connect with each other. They also offer hands-on learning experiences through selective project opportunities, which can help you gain practical experience and enhance your skills. You can get involved by reaching out to their contact, Rain Liu, at [rainliu@uchicago.edu](mailto:rainliu@uchicago.edu) or following them on social media.\n",
