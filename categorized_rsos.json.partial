    "full_description": "The American Lung Cancer Screening Initiative (ALCSI) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that consists of a network of students and doctors across the nation, striving to increase lung cancer screening awareness. Among all the university chapters of ALCSI, our UChicago chapter is uniquely positioned on the Southside of Chicago. Everyday we work to increase screening within the Southside of Chicago. We are partnered with the UChicago Medicine Screening Center and many other leaders who aim to decrease health inequity. Our goals are to make tangible impacts that save lives. Lung Cancer is the number one cause of cancer related death. In its early stages, lung cancer is often curable, but it is also silent. Thus, there is no way to detect it, except for screenings. However, if the lung cancer gets to late stages, it will metastasize. At that point, life expectancy is generally 2 years. Thus, screening is critical for saving lives. However, as of 2024, only 6% of vulnerable individuals are getting screened for lung cancer. Our team organizes grassroots events in the Southside of Chicago. We speak to thousands of individuals about lung cancer screening and help them determine if they are eligible for the screening. Our hardworking team members can be found at churches, festivals, health fairs, and food pantries. When they aren't in the field, they're writing thousands of emails to organize more events and helping enroll patients to get them screened. If these words speak to you, consider joining our team! This organization is not low commitment, as we seek individuals who are extremely passionate about our goals. We are a family and will help each other as needed, so you're never alone. You don't need to be a pre-med to join this extremely strategy oriented club. However, if you are, you will gain many unique clinical hours.",

Here are some of the projects that APAMSA is working on currently: 1)\u00a0APAMSA recently initiated a cultural humility program with the Bridgeport Free Clinic (BFC) to help Pritzker medical students learn more about the predominantly Chinese American patient population served by the BFC in order to better serve them. 2) APAMSA recently established a mentorship program, supported by the Office of Multicultural Students Affairs, for pre-medical students identifying as Asian/Pacific American (AAPI) at the University of Chicago. This program is a chance for AAPI pre-medical students to meet with AAPI medical students who have similar upbringings and callings to medicine and receive guidance on studying, medical school applications, and tips on opportunities to pursue to learn more about various pathways in health professions. 3) APAMSA is partnering with the South Asian Medical Students Association (SAMSA) in organizing the inaugural conferenceAsians in Medicine: A Conference on Advocacy and Allyshipon May 18th.\u00a0The objectives of this conference are threefold.\u00a0The first is to raise awareness of Asian American health disparities, such as the disproportionately high prevalence of HBV and diabetes, as well as to highlight the work of nonprofit organizations to serve the needs of various Asian American ethnic enclaves throughout Chicago, such as Chinatown and Devon. The second objective is to have Asian American medical leaders based throughout Chicago to meet with participants to talk about their career paths and to provide guidance on how to overcome the \u201cbamboo ceiling\u201d to pursue leadership positions in medicine. The final objective of the conference is to talk more critically about Asian Americans\u2019 position as overrepresented minorities in highly privileged professions such as medicine; discuss strategies for partnering with other communities of color to develop a common agenda for addressing systemic health disparities; and to provide a space for participants to talk about challenges faced by Asian American health professionals that are often ignored, such as microaggressions from colleagues and racism from patients. Please contact us if you have any questions about APAMSA's projects and joining our wonderful organization!",

It's a medium for stories that resonate deeply and one for tales nearly akin to stand up comedy: whatever you've been dying to say, you can say it here, and we'd be more than happy to have you. In the past, we've heard poems about lost love, politics, Burger King wedding vows, and so much more. We're here to make sure that the many talented voices of our community have the chance to explore the genre, learning and growing as writers, performers, and people. Okay, you get it, it's a good time. But what's itactuallylike to be a member? During each meeting, we partake in free-writing and tea-spilling, ending with a fun writing activity. Outside of weekly meetings, poets are encouraged to participate in more rigorous (and often more exciting) projects such as group performances. And of course, sharing your words with the people around you means you're more than likely to make a few new friends, too.",

    "full_description": "Established in June 2021,Charles River Economics Labs, Corp., is a group of undergraduates at the University of Chicago, Harvard University and Stanford University that conducts pro-bono scientific research and publication in the field of economics. The group partners with intergovernmental organizations, think tanks, and nonprofit organizations in doing so, with the main goal of supporting policymakers through pro-bono research. Our work involves the study, determination, and interpretation of economic, political, and social facts relating to questions of significance on behalf of our clients. Our research is conducted using objective scientific principles and academic norms \u2013 our conclusions are based on empirical evidence without regard to the special interests of any group in the body politic for governments and nonprofit organizations. For example, in Fall 2023 we worked with the Census Bureau to create a novel comprehensive dataset on the US Cannabis Industry, analyzing trends in license issuance, dispensary concentration, product pricing, etc. We presented our results to the Census ADEP Team and discussed the policy implications of our findings. Ultimately, our goal is to influence positive, welfare-maximizing change in public policy through economic analysis. Some of our former and current project partners across our 3 chapters include: Federal Agencies (Departments of Transportation, Commerce, Energy, State, Census Bureau), the UN Development Programme, Chelsea Public Schools, Brookings Institution, World Bank, and NASA.",

Commedia is a sixteenth-century art form hailing from Italia that marries physical theater, improvisation, mask work, song, dance, and slapstick humor. \u00a0It is the root of many of today\u2019s popular art forms, such as ballet, opera, pantomime, and sketch comedy. \u00a0We collaborate in the process of bringing this unique tradition into today\u2019s world with unbridled enjoyment. We believe in the fundamental power of the ensemble as an artistic unit. Working as an ensemble, where relationships, not individuals, define the audience\u2019s focus, helps us to create a compelling performance and also a community. When Commedia casts its ensemble, the Attori Senza Paura, we cast them for a year, as we feel a year is necessary to engender the type of familiarity needed to have a strong group of actors. Commedia approaches acting from a physical perspective. We connect to our characters emotionally by literally embodying them, and letting the mental aspect of the performance flow from this base. In other words, we love gestures. Commedia takes the art of not taking oneself seriously extremely seriously. Commedia understands that the human condition is often found in its extremes: characters fighting over a cookie as though it is a matter of life or death. We hope to convey this message to the UChicago populace.",

    "full_description": "The University of Chicago Emergency Medical Services (UCEMS) is a student-driven organization committed to providing exceptional emergency medical care and fostering a culture of preparedness within the University community. Our mission is to train, certify, and deploy Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) who operate within the scope of practice, ensuring the safety and well-being of individuals at various campus events and activities. UCEMS is dedicated to continuous improvement, collaboration with medical professionals, and contributing to the broader emergency medical education. Currently, UCEMS runs two training courses, provides opportunities for club members to practice emergency medicine by providing first aid assistance at intramural sports (facilitated through Intramural Director Matthew Fox), and puts on community building events to increase club membership and spread awareness of crucial life-saving skills (CPR, Stop the Bleed). First, we engage with the broader student community by offering an EMR (Emergency Medical Responders) course to provide interested students with a lower commitment, quarter-long course to learn the basics of emergency medicine and gain CPR licenses. Students who have taken our EMR course have expressed an interest in continuing to take an more intensive EMT course to obtain a higher level licensure which they can use to staff with UCEMS and access volunteer and career opportunities with emergency medical organizations across Chicago. EMRs and EMTs who have passed their respective classes are invited to join our Responder in Training (RIT) course, which consists of a 3 week review of unit procedures and scenario practice, before undergoing advancement testing to formally join UCEMS as a practicing responder. Practicing responders staff intramural sports events in teams of two, providing invaluable first aid supplies and on scene medical treatment for any injuries. Practicing responders also attend weekly drill sessions, which are community bonding events through which the UCEMS Quality Improvement Officer reviews or introduces new skills to the unit. UCEMS is also dedicated to promoting basic first aid and health literacy among our community. Every year, UCEMS leads a SPLASH course to certify local high school students in CPR. We also host quarterly open drills, open to all, in which unit members demonstrate skills such as splinting broken bones, controlling bleeding, or doing basic medical assessments, to encourage others to become involved in UCEMS and pursue an emergency medicine prehospital license. Within the unit, we host quarterly social events designed to connect students interested in pursuing medical careers to form a support network. Finally, we periodically invite our faculty club advisor (Dr. Willard Sharp of UCMed) and Pritzker Medical School students to speak at drill meetings to allow club members to learn about various careers in medicine. We look forward to continuing these professional development opportunities next year by connecting students with shadowing opportunities with emergency medicine physicians and allowing responders to gain more patient experience by operating at the EMT level.",

Finally, the Community Outreach working group takes all these results and works with community leaders to hone our solutions towards a feasible, sustainable product that can be implemented in the Chicago community. The ERG also runs the Intercollegiate Sustainability Alliance with 4 other Chicago colleges and helped to start the UChicago Environmental Alliance, a unified group of all environmental RSOs on campus.",

Annual EventsEvery year, the French Club brings the best of French culture to campus with three events open to the entire campus community. Past events have included: Speed-dating in French, Cheese Tasting, Study Abroad Q&A and Crepe Study Break. We are looking to introduce our \"Cultural Series\" this year, consisting of one major event per quarter, which will focus on one particular Francophone region. We will also offer one major event per quarter that focuses more on practicing French. Speaker SeriesLaunched in 2012, our Speaker Series seeks to foster discussion on a wide breadth of issues in contemporary France. We invite practitioners at the heart of French political and social life to share their experience and provide context surrounding certain \"Franco-French\" particularities, which can sometimes be baffling from an American perspective. Our first speaker was Fadela Amara, former French junior minister of Urban Policy and founder of the feminist organization Ni Putes Ni Soumises (Neither Whores Nor Submissive) which supported the 2010 ban on burqas in France. Since then, we have hosted events on campus with Julia Kristeva, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lefebvre, Henry Laurens, Laurent Fabuis, Dominique de Villepin, Zineb el Razhoui, and Marie-Monique Robin.",

Four core programs form the heart of the Institute: civic engagement opportunities that enable students to experience politics-in-action through political exploration trips, leadership training, service programs and voter engagement projects; visiting fellowships where distinguished political officials, policymakers, journalists, diplomats and others are in residence on campus during an academic quarter; political and public service internships that provide students with paid, substantive career development opportunities; and a continuous series of public events featuring leading political figures sharing their insights on key issues of the day.",

Our mission is to represent the Korean community and strengthen its voice on (and beyond) campus and to bring together those who have a common interest in Korean culture through social activities and events. Additionally, we seek to extend an open dialogue between a diverse range of ethnic groups in order to establish a positive relationship for the whole of the University community. Finally, we hope to spread awareness of the Korean culture to the entire student body by sponsoring various University-wide events. Our constitution may be found here. We also seek to give to the community by raising funds for various charitable organizations like Korean American Women In Need (KANWIN) and Agglobe Services (North Korean food aid).

The cornerstone of MEDLIFE is week-long mobile clinic trips to improve access to basic healthcare in low-resource communities in Latin America.\u00a0These trips are open to the general campus community, and provide an opportunity for students to engage in sustainable, locally-driven health clinics and development projects in rural communities. We also raise funds for development projects in Ecuador, Peru, and Tanzania that provide sustainable change in a culturally sensitive manner by funding clinics, schools, and safe living environments.Additionally, our chapter prioritizes local community engagement to improve health and well-being. The Community Service Committee organizes service trips to community-based organizations like Heartland Alliance Vital Bridges Food Pantry, Hyde Park Neighborhood Club, or Ronald McDonald House Charities.Our last goal as an organization is to increase awareness among the University community about global health and issues such as health equity. We strive to give students at the University a chance to discuss and research pertinent health problems, while also inviting multidisciplinary guest speakers to lead discussions or participate in panel presentations. For more information about MEDLIFE as an international organization, please visithttps://www.medlifemovement.org/.",
